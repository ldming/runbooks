# we will generally have fewer warm nodes than hot nodes. on hot nodes we
# want to spread the write load, and we do this by limiting total_shards_per_node.
# this avoids hotspotting by making colocation of written-to indices less likely.
#
# however, total_shards_per_node becomes a limiting factor when we transition to
# the warm phase, as we now have fewer nodes. in order to address this, we will
# loosen the total_shards_per_node constraint once an index is no longer being
# written to, allowing it to be packed more tightly on warm nodes.
