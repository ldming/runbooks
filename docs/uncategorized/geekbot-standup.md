# Managing Geekbot standups

## What is Geekbot?

[Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/) is a service we can use to facilitate Standups, Retros and other activities of that type in Slack.

## Managing/Creating Standups

You can login to Geekbot with your Slack Credentials and go to [the dashboard](https://app.geekbot.com/dashboard/home).
All standups that you are a part of will be listed there.  There should also be a `+New Standup` in the uppper right if you wish to create
a new standup for a team or other purpose.  They have many helpful templates if you wish to have a starting point.

The existing Geekbot [SRE Daily standup](https://app.geekbot.com/dashboard/standup/25831/view) as of February 2023 that goes to [#sre_standup](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C027DF6UCSJ) is managed by the infra managers.
